What happens when init a repo and why ---
A .git folder is added and we can start using git commands.
We can check on the status and such and maybe make a commit.
None of this gets tracked without a git init.
Adding/removing files is tracked too so don't worry about
deleting or creating new files. It's all tracked!

How is staging area diff from repo and cwd ---
It's really just a tag/label for the status of files.
It doesn't affect your repo. But it's prepping cwd files.
Remember, it's not moving anything. A commit doesn't change
anything. It just takes that snapshot. So the staging area
is really just getting thing into your lens before
taking an actual picture.

How can we use staging to ensure 1 logical change per commit---
Using git diff shows us diffs between cwd and staging.
git diff --staged shows us diffs between staging and last commit
We can ensure we've staged/added what we want to commit before
actually committing. And if we want out of it we can use...
git reset --hard.
