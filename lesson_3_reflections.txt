When would you want to use a remote repo rather than work local ---
If you're on a computer that you don't have your local work
on or perhaps isn't yours or doesn't have the software you
need. Or perhaps you wanted to avoid pushing work up but that 
seems like a minor hinderance.

Why pull changes manually instead of having GitHub stay up
to date automatically ---
Those changes might not be from you. You don't want to pull
in someone else's code that you know nothing about auto. Plus
you get to control what's in and what's not. Considering
the ease of use, that's an advantage.
